# An-Unfortunate-Misfeed
A RimWorld mod that adds the chance for guns to jam.

## Prerequisites
[HugsLib](https://github.com/UnlimitedHugs/RimworldHugsLib)

## Features
Guns jam based on the quality of the gun. These percentages can be altered using the HugsLib in game mod settings.

If a pawn tries to fire a jammed gun, they will attempt to clear the jam first. The chance of success is based on the pawns shooting skill. There is a minimum 20% chance to clear a jam, and the chance goes up by 5% for each experience level in shooting.
